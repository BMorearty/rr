# rr - Move file or directory to trash

Use `rr` in place of `rm` on a Mac to remove a file or directory.
Instead of deleting it, it just moves it to the Trash.
This is nice for huge directory trees because it happens instantly.

Options:

`-f`

> When deleting a directory, force deletion of the existing
> ~/.Trash/{dirname} if there is already one in the trash.
